# AlbumDisplayMaker
Program for making large wall displays

This program was written for my new 3rd Year house.
I had a large wall space and wanted to fill it with 
a display of all the albums that I like.
So I printed lots off and wrote this program
to run through and visualise potential ideas.

I have now put them all up in my room and it looks lovely.
There are some included examples of some outputs.
